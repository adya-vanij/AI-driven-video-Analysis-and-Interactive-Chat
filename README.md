<h1>AI-driven video Analysis and Interactive Chat</h1>
<h2>Agent Description</h2>
The Video Skimming and Q&A Agent is an AI-driven system designed to process video content and provide concise answers to user queries. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and video analysis, the agent skims through video material, identifies relevant sections, and extracts precise answers in response to text-based questions.
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Traditional video-based learning or information retrieval often requires users to manually search through lengthy video content, which is time-consuming and inefficient. The lack of a mechanism to directly access relevant sections of a video when seeking answers hampers user productivity and engagement.
<h2>Solution Statement</h2>
The Video Skimming and Q&A Agent addresses this challenge by enabling users to ask questions in text format and receive quick, contextually accurate answers derived from video content. The system enhances accessibility and usability of video resources by:
<li>Skimming through video content to locate relevant segments.</li>
<li>Extracting and summarizing key information.</li>
<li>Providing timestamped references to specific video sections for deeper insights.</li>
<h2>Process Flow</h2>

<h2>POC Deliverables</h2>
<li>A working prototype demonstrating video upload, indexing, and query-based retrieval.</li>
<li>User interface allowing text-based questions and providing timestamped answers.</li>
<li>Test datasets showcasing the agentâ€™s ability to process and retrieve information from diverse video types.</li>
<li>Documentation outlining system architecture, indexing algorithms, and query-answer workflows.</li>
<h2>Expected Benefits</h2>
<li>80% reduction in time spent searching through video content for specific answers.</li>
<li>75% improvement in user engagement and satisfaction by providing direct access to relevant information.</li>
<li>85% enhancement in productivity by enabling efficient video content utilization.</li>
<li>90% accuracy in aligning user queries with relevant video segments.</li>
<h2>Sample Data Requirements</h2>
<li>Video files with clear audio and accompanying metadata.</li>
<li>Transcripts or subtitles for accurate indexing (optional but beneficial).</li>
<li>Sample user questions to train and validate the query-answering functionality.</li>
